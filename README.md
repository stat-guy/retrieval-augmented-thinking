# Retrieval-Augmented Thinking MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that enhances AI model capabilities with structured, retrieval-augmented thinking processes. This server enables dynamic thought chains, parallel exploration paths, and recursive refinement cycles for improved reasoning and problem-solving.

## Features

- **Adaptive Thought Chains**: Maintains coherent reasoning flows with branching and revision capabilities
- **Iterative Hypothesis Generation**: Implements validation cycles for hypothesis testing
- **Context Coherence**: Preserves context across non-linear reasoning paths
- **Dynamic Scope Adjustment**: Supports flexible exploration and refinement
- **Quality Assessment**: Real-time evaluation of thought processes
- **Branch Management**: Handles parallel exploration paths
- **Revision Tracking**: Manages recursive refinement cycles

## Installation

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-retrieval-augmented-thinking
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
mcp-server-retrieval-augmented-thinking
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio';

// Initialize and run the server
const server = new Server({
  name: 'retrieval-augmented-thinking',
  version: '0.1.0'
});

// Connect transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

## Tool Configuration

The server provides a tool with the following parameters:

- `thought` (string): Current reasoning step
- `thoughtNumber` (number): Position in reasoning chain
- `totalThoughts` (number): Estimated scope
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Chain continuation signal
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Marks refinement steps
- `revisesThought` (number, optional): References target thought
- `branchFromThought` (number, optional): Branch origin point
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): Scope expansion signal

## Advanced Features

### Thought Chain Analytics

The server tracks various metrics for thought chain quality:

- Chain effectiveness
- Revision impact
- Branch success rate
- Overall quality
- Individual thought metrics (complexity, depth, quality, impact)

### Pattern Recognition

Analyzes thought patterns for:

- Reasoning structures
- Context preservation
- Hypothesis validation
- Solution coherence

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
