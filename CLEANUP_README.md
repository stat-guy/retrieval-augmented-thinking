# Repository Cleanup in Progress

This repository is being cleaned up to remove incorrect Chain of Draft MCP server files and prepare for the correct RAT (Retrieval Augmented Thinking) MCP server implementation.

## Files Being Removed
- index.js (wrong Chain of Draft server)
- lib/ directory and all contents (wrong implementation files)
- src/ directory (wrong TypeScript implementation)
- docs/ directory (wrong documentation)
- package.json (wrong dependencies and configuration)
- README.md (wrong documentation)
- test*.js files (wrong test files)
- tsconfig.json (wrong TypeScript config)
- CLAUDE.md (empty file)

## Files Being Kept
- .gitignore (appropriate for Node.js projects)
- LICENSE (MIT license is appropriate)

The repository will remain PUBLIC and keep the name "retrieval-augmented-thinking".
